In response, the general management has issued a series of guidelines to make production more\n","efficient and reduce operating costs without affecting quality or delivery times. One of the guidelines is\n","the hiring of temporary employees to expedite the company's response to potential demand spikes.\n","Given your knowledge in business analytics, Elysium's COO selected you to lead a pilot project at your\n","plant. The project consists of building a data mining model to estimate the amount of work hours needed\n","to complete weekly orders and decide how many temporary workers to hire according to demand.\n","You requested historical data about previous orders and the total number of recorded hours to complete\n","those orders. They brought you the following data on a weekly basis:\n","1. Number of pieces manufactured during the week (i.e., the size of the order). This information is\n","stored in 8 columns, one for each product that the plant manufactures.\n","2. Number of hours worked during that week to complete the manufactured pieces.\n","Analyze the data with Orange and answer the following questions. (First Class)\n","\n","• What type (s) of model would you consider for this problem?\n","\n","• Is there a risk of overfit with the type (s) of model you considered? How would you control it?\n","\n","Build the best model you can in Orange. (Second Class)\n","\n","• What metric did you use to decide that this is the best model?\n","\n","• Do you think more data would help the model improve? Why?\n","\n","• How would you use the model to decide how many temporary workers to hire?\n","\n","• What do you think would be the potential impact of your model on the business?\n","\n","• Would you use this model to decide how many workers to hire in other plants? Why? If you\n","would not use this model, what would you do instead?"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"FTCrLM3iLV1X","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
